 -This is a dice based game 
 
 -The rules are as follows:-
 
    1) You have to role the dice and the rolled number will get added to your current score if you hold the game before The dice rolls to one.
    2) If the rolled number displays a 1 then your opponent gets the chance to roll the dice.
    3) The one who reaches the 100 points first will be  declared as a winner.
